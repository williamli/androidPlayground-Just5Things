### Purpose

This app the final project for [_Google Study Jams'_](http://www.developerstudyjams.com) Udacity [Android for Beginnersâ€‹ course](https://www.udacity.com/account/affiliate/GoogleStudyJams). Around 3 hours of work was spent on this app from idea conceptualisation, layout design, code architecture, as well as function refactoring so that none of the code is repeated between the activities. A lot of the time was spent on making changes to the permission request flow and adapting it to work on Android M (v6).

### About The App

This app lists out five popular Korean restaurants in Hong Kong. Users can browse among these restaurants and explorer more information about them. They can also call the restaurants directly from the app by pressing the call button. 

Contents of this app were taken from [OpenRice](https://openrice.com).

### App's Architecture

This app uses various scroll views and CollapsingToolbars for layouts. All the contents of the app is stored as string resources. When run from Android M, the app uses the new in app permission checks / request prompts to try to dial from app directly. If user did not grant dial permission to app, the app will launch the dialer and populate it with the number to dial.
